=====================================

---------- Description -------------------
This website was developed for the purpose to spread awareness about wild
blueberry research. The WBRP is associated with Dalhousie University's
Faculty of Agriculture to engage in farther blueberry research and development.

---------- System Requirements -------------------
While using Bootstraps base template search engine compatibility
can be found with the following link:
https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/getting-started/browsers-devices/

---------- Adjusting Files -------------------
The majority of files can be adjusted as necessary however the following
files: bootstrap.min.css, bootstrap.min.js, holder.min.js, jquery-slim.min.js,
and popper.min.js should be left unchanged because these are "key" files and
making adjustments can have a negative effect on the web site. Otherwise
feel free to make adjustments.

---------- Level of Experience (LOE) -------------------
For those with minimal experience I would suggest that any editing
user to examine the cheat sheet provided within this section to get
better understanding of HTML/CSS and tags that are used.

me with developing this web site.
