    <p>
        The Wild Blueberry Research Program (WBRP) was established in 1996 as a result of collaborative efforts of
        the Nova Scotia Department of Agriculture, Bragg Lumber Company and the Wild Blueberry Producers Association
        of Nova Scotia. David Percival started as the research chair, and has continued to direct activities
        undertaken in the Maritime provinces. The continuous contributions of research staff, postdoctoral fellows,
        graduate and undergraduate students working in the WBRP have allowed for the ongoing development of
        technology based products, services and processes to address the unique and dynamic needs of the wild
        blueberry industry.
